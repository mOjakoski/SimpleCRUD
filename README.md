# Simple CRUD app
A simple app made with JavaScript, Node.js, Express and SQLite to create, read, update and delete items from a list. Comes with a dark mode so it is easy on the eyes. Do not run the PowerShell script for setting up the project, it is WIP!

Currently there is no way to "UPDATE" the list of items, therefore it is not a fully functional CRUDapp.
